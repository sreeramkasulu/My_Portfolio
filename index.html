        <h2>
        <p>I’m a passionate B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science & Engineering, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Currently, I am pursuing my degree at Pragati Engineering College in Andhra Pradesh, where I maintain a CGPA of 9.3/10.

            I have a strong foundation in various programming languages, including Python, Java, and C, complemented by my skills in data management and web development using Oracle, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My proficiency in tools and platforms such as Git, GitHub, and Google Cloud Platform allows me to work effectively on collaborative projects and cloud-based applications.
            
            Throughout my academic journey, I have actively participated in numerous extracurricular activities. As the Coordinator of the MATH Club and the TFUG (TensorFlow) Club, as well as a volunteer with the NSS Club, I have organized workshops and community service projects aimed at enhancing learning and promoting volunteerism among students. These leadership roles have helped me develop essential skills in project management and teamwork.
            
            I am excited about the future of technology and its potential to make a positive impact on society. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute to meaningful projects.</p>

            <h2>OTP Generator using Gmail SMTP Server</h2>
            <p>I developed an OTP (One-Time Password) generator using Python and Gmail’s SMTP server to facilitate secure email-based OTP verification. The project includes:</p>
            <p>Email Validation: Ensures the entered email belongs to common domains like Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.</p> 
            <p>OTP Generation: A 6-digit OTP is randomly generated.</p> 
            <p>OTP Delivery: The OTP is sent via email using the SMTP server.</p>
            <p>Resend Option: Users can opt to resend the OTP either to the same or a new email address if verification fails.</p>
            <p>This project demonstrates secure email handling and Python integration with SMTP for real-world applications.

            <h2>Constitution of India Chatbot</h2>
            <p>
              I developed a conversational AI chatbot that answers questions related to the Constitution of India. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing techniques, combining LangChain for document loading and splitting, SentenceTransformers for semantic search, and GPT-Neo for generating human-like responses. The chatbot allows users to interactively query content from the Constitution, providing accurate answers based on relevant sections of the document.</p>
            <p>Technologies Used:
            LangChain: Document loading and text processing.
            SentenceTransformers: Embedding generation for document similarity.
            GPT-Neo: Language model for text generation.
            Transformers & PyPDFLoader: For document parsing and question answering.</p>

            <h1>Project 3</h1>
            <h2>Telugu Character Recognition</h2>
            <p>I Developed a machine learning-based system for recognizing Telugu characters using deep learning techniques. The project involved training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on a labeled dataset of Telugu characters to accurately identify and classify them.
            Key Features:
              Built a web application interface using Flask to upload and recognize Telugu characters in real-time.
              Used TensorFlow to create and train a CNN model, achieving high accuracy in character recognition.
              Integrated a labeled dataset of Telugu characters for model training and evaluation.
              The final model is deployed for practical use, allowing users to test Telugu character inputs and receive classification results.
            Technologies Used:
              Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Keras
              HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web interface
              Model deployment via Flask with interactive UI
